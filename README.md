# iTrack

Eye tracking for accessibility.

## Installation

To interface with commands on a computer, we use [PyAutoGUI](https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui). For Mac users, type the following commands into a terminal to install PyAutoGUI:

```
pip3 install pyobjc-core
pip3 install pyobjc
pip3 install pyautogui
```

If you get an error that says something in the lines of ```ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Quartz'```, please go to the accessibility tab in your privacy settings and enable permissions for your terminal.

For Windows and Linux users, you can follow the installation instructions [here](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
